 Student Records Management System (Java)
This is a console-based Student Records Management System built using Java. It uses a singly linked list data structure to store and manage student information such as name, roll number, CGPA, and department.

 Features
 -Add Student Record: Insert a new student into the record.

 -View Records: Display all student records in a formatted list.

 -Search by Roll Number: Look up a studentâ€™s details using their roll number.

 -Delete Record: Remove a student from the record based on their roll number.

 -Duplicate Check: Prevent adding a student if the roll number already exists.

 How It Works
Student data is stored in a custom singly linked list (WholeRecordLinkedList).
-addNewStudent(String name, int rollNumber, double cgpa, String department)
Adds a new student record to the end of the linked list.

-printingList()
Prints all the student records in a formatted list, along with a total record count.

-searchingStudentByRollnoMethod(int rollNumber)
Searches for a student by roll number and displays their full details if found.

-deletingStudentByRollno(int rollNumber)
Deletes a student record from the list by roll number, if it exists.

-traversingMethod(int rollNumber)
Checks if a roll number already exists in the list (used to prevent duplicates).

Each student is represented as a Node with attributes:

studentName

rollNumber

cgpa

department

The list is traversed for search, delete, and duplicate check operations.

 Program Flow
Upon execution, the user is greeted with a menu:

-------Welcome to Student Records Management System-------
-> Press 1 to VIEW existing students Record
-> Press 2 to ADD new student in Record
-> Press 3 to SEARCH for a student in the Record
-> Press 4 to DELETE any Record
-> Press 5 to EXIT
The program includes some pre-added dummy records for demonstration and testing.

Technologies Used
-Java (Console-based)
-OOP Concepts: Encapsulation, Classes
-Data Structures: Singly Linked List

Java Utilities: Scanner for user input

 To Improve / Next Steps
Add file-based saving/loading for persistent data.

Replace linked list with ArrayList or HashMap for efficiency.

Create a GUI version using JavaFX or Swing.

Implement sorting/filtering functionality.
